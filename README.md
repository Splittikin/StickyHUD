For non-Steam friends, you'll want to download [this ZIP archive](https://github.com/Splittikin/StickyHUD/raw/master/StickyHUD.zip) and extract it into your RainWorld/RainWorld_Data/StreamingAssets/mods folder (so that you have a folder inside named StickyHUD with the ModInfo.json and Thumbnail.png immediately inside.)
